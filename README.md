# AccountManager
A demo account manager application developed using Java following the agile development process. Developed as a project for CSHU 271 - Boise State University

## Reflection

### What are the main issues about your team’s development process? How can they be addressed?
I think one of the main issues our team was the lack of communication among the team members. However, we tried to resolve the issue by making a group in messenger and that worked well in the end. Another issue of our team was that we didn’t know what expertise each of the members had. That’s why we had to assign tasks randomly without thinking about the strong suit of certain members. I think if we had better communication, we all could knew about each other’s strong side in terms of developing software and assign tasks based on that. 
For version control, we used git and GitHub repository to store our codes. But, since most of my teammates had less experience with it, we couldn’t use git in the proper way. I think if all my team members had the same level of experience with git, it would be much easier for us to version control our software. 
Other than a few minor issues, we didn’t have much problem since every one of us was being open-minded and tried to finish our tasks before the deadline.

### What did you personally gain from the project?
I think working on the project together with other people made me realize how important it is to communicate and use managing software to track our development process. Since this was my first time working with JavaFx, I learned a lot of advanced features that aren’t available in Swing. I also realized that some of my codes could have been written and organized better if I used developing frameworks like MVC or MVVM. Yes, I knew about these frameworks before, but never really felt the need for it. But, this time, I really felt the usefulness of these development frameworks. Working on this project made me understand that these frameworks can make it much easier to write better codes. 

### What does your program do well, and what could your program do better?
I think our program does pretty well in having all the features mentioned in our Product backlog. The user can easily create an account with valid inputs and all the validation gets done in real-time. The user can then log in, see the profile, edit it and then save it. Our program can also let the user know his/her username and passwords if forgotten with proper validation. So, it pretty much has all the necessary components for a user account managing software.
Of course, there are a lot of room for improvements in our program. I think if we could connect our application to a database, or store the data in a file, it would have been better. We could also implement a way to retrieve forgotten password and username via email using third party libraries. The UI design and its experience could be better so that all the pages look coherent.
